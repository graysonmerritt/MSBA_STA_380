```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1
We are looking for P(Yes|TC)
P(Yes|RC) = .5
P(No|RC) = .5
P(Yes) = .65
P(No) = .35
P(RC) = .3

The total law of probability states that P(A) = the summation of P(A|B) * P(B)
The P(Yes) comes from only two conditional probabilities: P(Yes|RC) and P(Yes|TC)
So P(Yes)=P(Yes∣RC)P(RC)+P(Yes∣TC)P(TC)
Using some algebra I can arrange this to (P(Yes) - P(Yes|RC)P(RC)) / P(TC) = P(Yes∣TC)
Thus, P(Yes|TC) is **71.43%**

```{r Problem 1}
p_yes_rc = .5
p_no_rc = .5
p_yes = .65
p_no = .35
p_rc = .3
p_tc = .7
p_yes_tc = (p_yes-p_yes_rc*p_rc) / p_tc
p_yes_tc
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
